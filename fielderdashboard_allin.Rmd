## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(finished_dash)
```




```{r Save Plot}
ggsave(filename = "muncy_max_finished_dash.jpg", plot = finished_dash, width = 10, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 300)


```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
